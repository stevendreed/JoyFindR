## Usage 

Usage will consist of searching for game titles using an input field, where the results will gradually be displayed on screen as the user hits submit. Upon clicking 'Search', the request will be sent to the API, where it will send back a response to the client in HTML form. The indicated game that was entered will eventually be returned in several results with a 'Save' button below each result to indicate whether the user wishes to have them saved to their Wishlist for a future reference. As the user clicks on a game, the person will then be taken to a game info page, where the indicated game's release date, ratings, and genres will be returned, with a corresponding meme gif that will also be displayed to add some humor.

## Support 

The application utilizes third-party software from websites, such as Rawg.io or Giphy.com. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application will emphasize code logic to successfully adhere to the userâ€™s interactions and to be visually appealing
